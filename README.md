# DeepMotion

A Deep Learning based project to detect American Sign Language(ASL) using the Leap Motion sensor.

### Leap Motion SDK
To start using the Leap Motion SDK click [here](https://developer-archive.leapmotion.com/documentation/python/index.html)

### Generate the dataset
The dataset is generated by connecting the Leap Motion sensor and running `generate-data.py`

### Training the data
I have used DNNClassifier of Tensorflow high level Estimator API to train the model.

### Generate the speech output
I have used gTTS(Google Text To Speech) to generate the audio file. You can find the example in `sign-detect.py`

### Test the data
Create a file using the `generate-data.py` and run the test code in `sign-detect.py` to output the speech equivalent
of the given sign.
